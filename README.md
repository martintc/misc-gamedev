# misc-gamedev

Just a repo with various projects for dabbling. Avaible for anyone to pick through in case they find anyone useful. It also makes it easier to transfer code bases between my machine. Instead of having separate repos for code that is just dabbling.

I will try to maintain a README in each sub-repo with a description once I have a few little codebases in here.
