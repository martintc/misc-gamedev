# top-down-map-render

Just a little C++ codebase written on my mac that will draw a map and a player in the map.

Maps are just lines based off a beginning and ending vertex.

## Dependencies
- SDL3

## TODO
- [ ] Create a map file format
- [ ] Parse map file
- [ ] Some form of asset store to hold maps
- [ ] Load and render map file into "level"
